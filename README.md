# Fancy code test ðŸ’¥

At Fancy, we want to deliver our customers what they want, when they want it. To make sure that can happen we have a packer app that helps our pickers pack bags as quickly as possible.

In the following task, we want to recreate a similar experience.

## Task:
Build an app that:
* Times the user to complete 2 tasks:

    1. Asks the user to select all the cells in a tableview with the same colour - as nominated by you.
    2. Task of your choosing (use your imagination, and no need to overcomplicate it!)
    
* Designs should be simple, and clean.
